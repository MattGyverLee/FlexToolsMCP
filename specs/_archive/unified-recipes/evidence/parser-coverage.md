# Evidence: parser-coverage

- **Verified by**: `sena3-read`
- **Project**: Sena 3 (asserted with `flextools_list_projects`, which returned `Sena 3` and `Sena_InterlinearTraining`; session `flextools_start(project_name="Sena 3", write_enabled=False)`)
- **flexicon**: 4.11.0 (installed = index, exact match)
- **Run**: `flextools_run_module(source="existing")`, whole recipe file unchanged, read-only
- **op_id**: `op-012434893-006`
- **Params**: defaults (`COUNT = 10`)
- **Date**: 2026-09-28
- **raw_lcm_lines**: 0

## Report excerpt

```text
parser coverage: 157/6557 occurring wordforms (2.4%)
total unparsed with occurrences: 6400

## Notes

The seed file (T011) printed only the unparsed count. FR-050 asks for the coverage percentage, so a `parser coverage: parsed/occurring (pct)` line was added before this run. An earlier run of the unchanged seed (op-012359943-005) produced the same list without the percentage line.

The hash was taken before the first read run of the batch, between runs, and
after the last run. It never changed, so this run left the file untouched.
