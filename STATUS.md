# Project Status

Active feature: **diagnostic-report** ("send this to the maintainer" flow).
Spec: `specs/diagnostic-report/SPEC.md` (APPROVED-WITH-EDITS).
Checkpoint plan: `specs/diagnostic-report/tasks.md`.

## Where we are

**CP1 -- Foundation: COMPLETE and green (2026-07-13).** All six checklist items
landed; both cycle-2 P1s resolved (`save_store` fail-open fixed in cycle 3;
casting-recurrence heuristic deferred into CP2 and now closed there). See
`specs/diagnostic-report/tasks.md` CP1 checkpoint for detail.

**CP2 -- Reconstruction + normalization: COMPLETE and green (2026-07-13, spurt 2,
cycles 4-6).**

All six CP2 line-items landed: slice reconstruction, rotation stitching,
`MAX_REPORT_OPS` summarize-not-drop, path-scoped machine-hygiene normalization,
report rendering, and casting-recurrence signature precision. Gate results:

- **Verification PASS.** Full suite **511 passed / 0 failed** (+1 from the 510
  baseline, no regressions). All six spec section-12 Reconstruction clauses are
  test-backed; zero forbidden imports.
- **Domain E2 privacy gate PASS** -- home-dir / OS-username substitution is
  anchored on path-shaped tokens only, never a document-wide username
  find/replace.
- **Cycle-2 casting-recurrence P1 CLOSED** -- real `casting_signature` threaded
  into the JSONL schema; recurrence keys on it, not the bare code.
- **Cycle-6 post-auto-fix stale-`issues` P1 FIXED + verified.** Cycle 5 found
  that `handlers/execution.py` left `issues` bound to the pre-auto-fix casting
  set after the Issue #46 auto-fix reran `detect_casting_needs`, so a partial
  auto-fix reported the stale (resolved+residual) set instead of only the
  residual issue. Fixed by re-deriving `issues` right after the post-fix
  `casting_check` reassignment; regression test
  `test_partial_auto_fix_reports_only_residual_casting_issue` confirmed failing
  pre-fix and passing post-fix. See `reviews/cycle5-*` and `reviews/cycle6-*`.

**CP2 carryover (P2, non-blocking):** two P2s deferred to harden during CP3 --
`reconstruct.py` mismatched-`End` silent truncation, and `render.py`
`_CODE_STOP_MARKERS` substring false-positive.

## Next pickup

**CP3 -- Surface + transport + guard.** Implement the `flextools_prepare_report`
tool (spec section 10; explicit `op_id`/`op_ids`/`steps_back`, defaults to the
whole turn) and the `diagnostic_report` advisory block on `RunModuleSuccess`
(additive optional field, no contract bump per Q5). CP3 also lands the three
transports (`gh` CLI / prefilled issue URL / `mailto:`), the
`likely_contains_lexical_data` code-shape flag (Q4), and the two-layer
no-transmission guard (static AST scan + dynamic monkeypatch of
`subprocess`/`gh`/`smtplib`/`webbrowser`/`urllib`/`socket`). See `tasks.md` CP3
section. Fold the two CP2-carryover P2s into the CP3 rotation/render work.

## Housekeeping note (not part of diagnostic-report)

The working tree carries unrelated pre-existing changes to
`src/flextoolsmcp/server/validators.py` and
`tests/test_validator_cluster_fixes.py`. These are NOT part of the
diagnostic-report feature -- do not sweep them into a diagnostic-report commit;
commit or revert them deliberately on their own.
